## Course Thesis

Data visualization can positively impact our understanding of public health and how we improve public health

## Ex 1: Florence Nightingale (1820-1910)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Statistician, nurse, and writer

Military nurse for Great Britian during Crimean War

Realized that her audience (the British royalty, generals, and politicians) didn't understand tables. Used statistical graphics to advocate for legislation that improved public health

> The [British Public Health Act of 1875] established requirements for well-built sewers, clean running water and regulated building codes. The law and the precedent it set worldwide would be driving forces...in doubling the average human life span during the following century.

## Clearing up some misconceptions

Although normally presented as strict-cause effect, truth is not as clear cut

- Cholera cases were already declining prior to removal
- Snow made his plot after removal of the handle

## Update: Handle is still gone

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the principles of effective and accurate graphical representation of different data types;

2.  To draw conclusions from graphical representations about relationships and trends in variables;

3.  To understand how graphical representations of data can be used to mislead or exaggerate relationships;

4.  To create and improve data visualizations using the R statistical environment;

## What will we be doing in class?

1. Lectures on data visualization principles, technical topics, code, and case study (me)

2. Coding together (us)

3. Plots of the week (you)

4. Two in-class quizzes (you)

## How will your grade be determined?

1. Modules 1-3 of online course “Arranging and Visualizing Data in R” (26%)

  <https://www.coursera.org/learn/arranging-visualizing-data-r>

2. Plot of the week (30%)

3. Out-of-class assessments (3x; 7% each)

4. In-class quizzes (2x; 8% each)

5. Participation through attendance (7%)

## Next steps

1. Complete office hours poll: <https://whenisgood.net/spy772s>

2. Create Coursera account using your umich email and register for *Arranging and Visualizing Data in R* course: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/arranging-visualizing-data-r/>

3. Create a [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) account. Recommended but not required to use your umich email

4. Join the PH345 workspace via the link on the Canvas Homepage
