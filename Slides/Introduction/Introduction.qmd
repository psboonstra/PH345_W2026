## Course Thesis

Data visualization can positively impact our understanding of public health and how we improve public health

## Ex 1: Florence Nightingale (1820-1910)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Statistician, nurse, and writer

Military nurse for Great Britian during Crimean War

Realized that her audience (the British royalty, generals, and politicians) didn't understand tables. Used statistical graphics to advocate for legislation that improved public health

> The [British Public Health Act of 1875] established requirements for well-built sewers, clean running water and regulated building codes. The law and the precedent it set worldwide would be driving forces...in doubling the average human life span during the following century.

## Ex 2: Gapminder and Life Expectancy

Chapter 2 of Unwin (2024)

> Gapminder identifies systematic misconceptions about important global trends and proportions and uses reliable data to develop easy to understand teaching materials to rid people of their misconceptions

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Chloropeth: graduated colors

-   Provinces are different sizes, different populations

-   Comparison across provinces is difficult

![](Covid01.png)
:::
:::::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Bar chart of number of cases for each Chinese province

-   Is a map justified?
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](Covid02.png)
:::
:::::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Blue replaces red. Less "emotive"

-   Rates replace totals

-   Hubei province rightly set apart from others

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](Covid03.png)
:::
:::::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Dots representing 10 cases randomly placed in each province

-   Potential misleading conclusion that Hubei province was overwhelmed
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](Covid04.png)
:::
:::::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Totals represented by proportional circles

-   Not adjusted for population

-   All areas represented, e.g. Macau and Hong Kong
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](Covid05.png)
:::
:::::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Log-transformed totals

-   Importance of legend

-   Logarithm de-emphasizes extremely large values but risks over-emphasizing small values
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](Covid06.png)
:::
:::::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Inappropriate ‘smoothing’ of data based upon geographic center

-   Epicenter (Hubei) is lost

-   Suggests all of eastern China was overwhelmed
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](Covid07.png)
:::
:::::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Choice of projection

-   Web Mercator: up is always north. Distortions lead to risk of misinterpreting geographic area

-   Albers Equal Area preserves geographic area but can distort shape

British physician, a founder of modern epidemiology 

Gathered data to refute 'miasma theory' of diseases that disease spread through bad air

## Clearing up some misconceptions

Although normally presented as strict-cause effect, truth is not as clear cut

- Cholera cases were already declining prior to removal
- Snow made his plot after removal of the handle

## Update: Handle is still gone

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the principles of effective and accurate graphical representation of different data types;

2.  To draw conclusions from graphical representations about relationships and trends in variables;

3.  To understand how graphical representations of data can be used to mislead or exaggerate relationships;

4.  To create and improve data visualizations using the R statistical environment;

## What will we be doing in class?

1. Lectures on data visualization principles, technical topics, code, and case study (me)

2. Coding together (us)

3. Plots of the week (you)

4. Two in-class quizzes (you)

## How will your grade be determined?

1. Modules 1-3 of online course “Arranging and Visualizing Data in R” (26%)
<https://www.coursera.org/learn/arranging-visualizing-data-r>

2. Plot of the week

3. Out-of-class assessments (3x)

4. In-class quizzes (2x)

5. Participation through attendance

## Next steps

1. Complete office hours poll: <https://whenisgood.net/rmixcrd>

2. Create Coursera account using your umich email and register for *Arranging and Visualizing Data in R* course: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/arranging-visualizing-data-r/>

3. Create posit.cloud account. Recommended but not required to use your umich email

4. Join the PH345 workspace via <https://posit.cloud/spaces/600155/join?access_code=Lv4YkrpGmhlIC-bGQwKOPYmLdO1a5mVzhqmZtFGm>
